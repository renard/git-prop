== NAME ==

git-prop - Handle svn properties like attribute in git

== SYNOPSIS ==

git prop [-h] [--data PATH] [--verbose] {init,restore,set,dump,delete} FILES

== DESCRIPTION ==

Git (currently) cannot handle properties like +svn prop+ does. This is
useful to ensure permission to a file for example a ssh private key *must*
be set to +0600+ which git cannot handle. with +git prop+ you can set
permission to that particular file and automaticaly restore them after merge
or checkout.

== OPTIONS ==

--data DATA::

  Set the +git-meta+ database file (default: '.gitprop' in git top level
  directory).

== COMMANDS ==

init::

  Create hooks in git hooks directory.

set PROPNAME PROPVALUE file [ files ]::

  Set property +PROPNAME+ to value +PROPVALUE+ for files.

delete PROPNAME [ file ]::

  Delete property +PROPNAME+ for files.

restore [ files ]::

  Restore all properties for files or all git known files.

dump::

  Dump all known properties for all files.


== DATABASE FORMAT ==

The database format is quiet simple. It consists of a JSON dump of a
dictionnary for which the file name is the key and the file attributes are
the properties values.

=== Dictionnary format ===

The key is composed of the full filename path starting from the git
repository root.

Each values are:

- +mode+: the file permissions in decimal format.


Currently only +mode+ is supported.

== USING WITH GIT HOOKS ==

Manual use +git prop+ is not that much handy. It can be configured to be
used directly withing githooks(5), specially *pre-commit* for the backup and
*post-merge* for the restore. to set up the hooks you can run:

   git prop init

== SEE ALSO ==

git(1), githooks(5).

== BUGS ==

No time to include bugs, command actions might seldom lead astray user's
assumption.
