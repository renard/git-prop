Description: Handle svn properties like attribute in git
 Git (currently) cannot handle properties like svn prop does. This is useful
 to ensure permission to a file for example a ssh private key must be set to
 0600 which git cannot handle. with git prop you can set permission to that
 particular file and automaticaly restore them after merge or checkout.
 .
 All informations are stored in a .gitprop file managed itself by git.
 .
 Using git hooks may automate the backup and restore process.
